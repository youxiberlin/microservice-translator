# Lengoo Coding challenge

**Requirement**ã€€

NodeJS newer than v12.14.1

## How to run the application

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Install all the dependencies at root directory
```
$ yarn install:all

# or 

$ npm run install:all
```
**NOTE:** `yarn install` or `npm run install` does not install all the dependencies of micro servicies. Please make sure to use `install:all`

3. Set environment variables

To run the application, please sent the following environment variables at root directory.
```
AMQP_URL='' // required: to connect AMQP Ex.) 'amqps://xxxxx'
MAIL_HOST='' // required: to send email Ex.) smtp.mailtra.io
MAIL_PORT='' // required
MAIL_USER='' // required
MAIL_PASS='' // required
GATEWAY_PORT='' // optional: default is set to 3000
TRANSLATOR_PORT='' // optional: default is set to 3001
MAILER_PORT='' // optional: default is set to 3002
TMS_PORT='' // optional: default is set to 3003
DEV_MAILSENDER='' // Please set an email address to use as a sender of email
DEV_MAILRECIPIENT='' // optional: recipient email address to send the test email to
```

3. Run all the micro services
I used PM2 to manage the process. If you have not installed PM2, [please install it](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/).
```
$ yarn start

# or 

$ npm run start
```

4. Stop all the processes
```
$ yarn stop

# or 

$ npm run stop
```

**NOTE:** Alternatively, you can run each micro service by running `yarn start` or `npm run start` under the directory of each service. 

Example:
To run only `gateway` service
```
cd ./gatweay
yarn start or npm run start
```
